1.)	Overview Of the Dataset
The dataset appears to contain records related to medical insurance costs and demographic attributes of individuals. The key attributes include:
•	Age (years): The age of the individual.
•	Sex (Male/Female): The gender of the individual.
•	BMI (Body Mass Index): A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
•	Children: The number of children the individual has.
•	Smoker (Yes/No): Whether the individual is a smoker.
•	Region: The geographic region where the individual resides (e.g., Southwest, Southeast, Northwest, Northeast).
•	Charges (Medical Expenses in USD): The total medical insurance cost for the individual.

This dataset is useful for analyzing the impact of various factors (such as BMI, smoking habits, and region) on medical expenses and can be used for predictive modeling in healthcare cost analysis.


2.)	Data check
•	The BMI has 12 missing values
•	Charges have 5 missing values
•	Only 1 duplicate is found
•	Age and Children have integer, BMI and Charges have Float and Sex,  Smoke, Region have Object Data types

3.)	Univariate Analysis:
o	Majority of people are below 20 years old.
o	Most people have medical charges below 5000.
o	Southeast has the highest number of people.

4.)	Bivariate Analysis:
o	Older individuals have higher medical costs.
o	BMI remains constant across ages but has outliers.
o	Higher BMI leads to higher medical charges.
o	BMI distribution is similar across all regions.

5.)	Multivariate Analysis:
o	Pair Plot: Showed relationships between numerical variables.
o	Heatmap: Highlighted correlations.
o	Grouped Bar Chart: Showed salary variations across categories.
o	Violin Plot: Demonstrated variations in age distribution
